# PalindromeCheckerApp
The **Palindrome Checker Management System** is a Java console application developed using a structured use case approach to demonstrate core programming concepts. The objective is to check whether a given word or sentence is a palindrome while applying concepts such as classes, the `main()` method, static keyword, input handling, string manipulation, and conditional logic. The project flow begins with displaying a welcome message (UC1), then accepting user input (UC2), processing the palindrome logic (UC3), and finally displaying the result with program control options (UC4). The system follows a clear and organized flow from startup to termination.
